# Get Started with Streaming Telemetry on Open NX-OS - Part 3

In parts 1 and 2 we learned how to configure streaming telemetry on NX-OS using _show commands_ and the _DME_, or Data Modeling Engine. In this section, we will learn how to consume the data and visualize it, using a big data analysis platform like **ElasticSearch** (formerly known as the ELK Stack). We will collect the CPU and memory utilization data from Open NX-OS devices and visualize it within the **Kibana** dashboard.
If you are not familiar with the ELK or Elastic Stack, don't worry. We will be covering a high level overview of the components and how they are used for analyzing the data.

## Preparing the Switches

**STOP:** You should ensure that the [NXOS Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology) lab is reserved before starting as it takes a few minutes to get started!

*The first lab in this module includes a detailed walkthrough of reserving the Sandbox if needed.*  

This lab is designed to be run from the DevBox included in the Sandbox.  You will connect to the DevBox via SSH and execute the lab through the terminal.  The SSH session can be done using the Guacamole Web Console, or directly SSHing to the server.  

> Note: Both options to connect require you are VPN'd to the Sandbox.

```bash
$ ssh root@10.10.20.20

# Ensure that Dependencies are Configured

If you are working on this lab directly after completing Part 2, you may skip this section. If not, please install the Python `flask` library on the devbox as follows:

Log into the devbox and perform the following:

```shell

(python2) [root@localhost telemetry]# pip install -r requirements.txt

(python2) [root@localhost telemetry]#
```

Now fire up the `simple_collector.py` app used in Part 1, as follows:

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost telemetry]# python simple_collector.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8888/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 171-300-662

```
As you can see the app is listening on port `8888` and will be used as the destination listener for our telemetry configuration.
