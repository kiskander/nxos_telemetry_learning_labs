## Visualizing the data collected

When we ran the Ansible playbook earlier, it created a dashboard for us that charts out the CPU and memory utilization metrics.

Click on "Dashboard" on the left panel of the webpage.

This takes you the dashboards that are currently configured on Elastic Stack. Go ahead and click on the `NXOS Dashboard`.

> Note that the configuration for visualizing this dashboard was previously created. The configuration was applied when we ran the playbook earlier.


You can click on individual graphs and observe the CPU and memory utilization data coming in from `nx-osv9000-1`.

Thus, in this lab, you configured an Open NX-OS switch to monitor CPU and memory utilization using the `show system resources` command. You then configured the device to stream this data over HTTP using JSON encoding to the `simple_collecter.py` app.  The app also then prepared the data into a file for consumption into the Elastic Stack, in which you were able to visualize the data streamed by the switch.
