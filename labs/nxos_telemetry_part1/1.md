# Get Started with Streaming Telemetry on Open NX-OS

Network equipment monitoring has traditionally relied on SNMP. And whenever SNMP MIBs did not exist for a certain monitoring criteria, network engineers have had to  resort to _screen scraping the CLI_ by parsing show commands and config files.

One of the biggest drawbacks with either of these methods is that both of these imply a central polling server that periodically makes SNMP queries (or repeatedly connects via telnet/SSH).  In other words, these methods _pull_ data from the device.  The pull model does not scale when there is more than one network management station (NMS) in the network. With this type of model, the network device sends data only when the NMS (or server) requests it. To initiate such requests, continual manual intervention is required. This continual manual intervention makes the pull model inefficient while also enhancing visibility in your environment.

Cisco's Open NX-OS devices support a push model, which continuously streams data from the network device to a server configured to receive _the stream of data_.  This is what's often referred to as _streaming telemetry_.  Streaming telemetry enables the push model, which provides near real-time access to monitoring data (based on how often the devices push data), and streams it to what is called a collector.

The NX-OS telemetry feature supports two ways in which the device can stream, or push, monitored data to the collector:

  - Using the NX-OS Data Modeling Engine (DME) defined models
  - Using the NX-API CLI

The DME is an information-model-based architecture in which the model describes all the information that can be monitored (and controlled) by a management process. Object instances are referred to as managed objects (MOs). Every managed object in the system can be identified by a unique distinguished name (DN). This model is fully [documented](https://developer.cisco.com/media/dme/index.html) An example to help illustrate this would be `sys/intf` a data model [representation](https://developer.cisco.com/media/dme/index.html) of the device's interface. The attributes of this model can be used to configure or monitor it.

> Note: the concept of MOs and DNs within Open NX-OS is the same exact concept as used in the Cisco ACI platform.

On the other hand, NX-API CLI can collect and stream switch information using show commands.

However, using the NX-API instead of streaming data from the DME has inherent scale limitations due to how NX-API consumes internal Linux processes.
