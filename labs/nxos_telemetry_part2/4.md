### Interested in more detail on Streaming Telemetry on NX-OS?

You can learn more about telemetry on the NX-OS in the [NX-OS Programmability Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x_chapter_011000.html)

Telemetry on the NXOS is still a very new feature and it is important to be cognizant of some of it's limitations. Telemetry is supported in Cisco NX-OS releases starting from 7.0(3)I5(1) for releases that support the [Data Management Engine](https://developer.cisco.com/site/nx-api/documents/n3k-n9k-api-ref/?shell#) (DME) Native Model.

A comprehensive list of restrictions and guidelines are [published](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x_chapter_011000.html#id_40825) on Cisco's website.
