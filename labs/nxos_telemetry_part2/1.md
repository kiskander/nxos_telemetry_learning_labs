# Get Started with Streaming Telemetry on Open NX-OS - Part 2

In Part 1 to the introduction to streaming Telemetry on Open NX-OS, we saw how to configure telemetry and collect data from a device using _show commands_. In this section we will look at a more production-like scenario and stream BGP related telemetry from 4 NX-OS devices to a central collector, leveraging the Data Modeling Engine.

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with Linux file navigation & package installation
- Familiarity with JSON
- **Complete** the Intro Lab [Streaming Telemetry on Open NX-OS - Intro](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/telemetry_nxos/nxos_telemetry_part1/step/1)

## Objectives

- Learn how to configure telemetry for streaming show command output using NX-API
- Learn how to collect and perform basic visualization of the data collected


## Preparing the Switches

**STOP:** You should ensure that the [NXOS Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology) lab is reserved before starting as it takes a few minutes to get started!

*The first lab in this module includes a detailed walkthrough of reserving the Sandbox if needed.*  

This lab is designed to be run from the DevBox included in the Sandbox.  You will connect to the DevBox via SSH and execute the lab through the terminal.  The SSH session can be done using the Guacamole Web Console, or directly SSHing to the server.  

> Note: Both options to connect require you are VPN'd to the Sandbox.

```bash
$ ssh root@10.10.20.20

[Kareem - cannot do any of the steps below since i dont have root access to the devbox, i used developer/C1sco123 per SB reservation 
and root/cisco123 does not work and hence the home direcoty needs to be changed as well from /root/* to /home/developer/code ]



# Ensure that Dependencies are Configured

If you are working on Part 2 of the lab, directly after completing Part 1, you may skip this section. If not, please install the Python `flask` library on the devbox as follows:

Log into the devbox and perform the following:

```shell

(python2) [root@localhost sbx_nxos]# pip install -r learning_labs/telemetry/requirements.txt
